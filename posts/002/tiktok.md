I tried the China City Vibe test and got Dalian at 92% 🌊

## content

I was just trying this for fun while planning a China trip, and Dalian came out as my top match (92%). The “coastal, relaxed, still practical” vibe actually feels pretty accurate for me. It also suggested Qingdao, Xiamen, Hangzhou, and Kunming, which is now basically my shortlist. Helpful if you’re still figuring out what kind of city pace you want.
