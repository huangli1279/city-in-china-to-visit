I took the China City Vibe test and it skipped Shanghai… gave me Zhuhai at 87% 🌊

## content

Was fully expecting Shanghai or Shenzhen. Got Zhuhai (87%) — "The Leisure Coast." Apparently I'm a Natural Wonder + Relaxed Pace type, which honestly tracks. The quiz said I pick cities by how good they feel, not how packed the itinerary is. It also matched me with Dalian, Shanghai, and Xiamen as runners-up, so the list isn't bad either. Worth trying if you're still deciding — bestcityinchina.site
