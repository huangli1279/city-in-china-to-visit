The China City Vibe test gave me Xiamen at 90% 🏝️ honestly not mad about it

## content

Took the City Vibe Matcher quiz and got Xiamen (90%) — "The Coastal Charmer." History Buff + Social Explorer apparently, which means ocean breezes, Gulangyu island, slow seafood lunches, streets that actually feel lived-in. The runners-up were Chengdu, Qingdao, Hangzhou, and Nanjing — which is now my entire China shortlist. If you can't pick a city, just let the quiz decide. bestcityinchina.site
