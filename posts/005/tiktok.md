I took the China City Vibe test and got Xi'an at 93% — apparently I'm a history nerd 🏯

## content

Took this China City Vibe quiz and it gave me Xi'an (93%) — "The Ancient." It said I'm drawn to places where civilization ran deepest, which... fair. Terracotta Army, ancient city walls, the Muslim Quarter — now I actually want to go. Runner-ups were Beijing (89%), Nanjing (88%), Wuhan (85%), and Changsha (83%). Basically a history lover's shortlist. If you're into that kind of trip, try it at bestcityinchina.site
