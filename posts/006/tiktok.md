China city quiz matched me with Shanghai at 72% — "The Cosmopolitan" 🌆 Solo Wanderer confirmed

## content

Took the City Vibe Matcher and got Shanghai (72%) — "The Cosmopolitan." It called me a City Explorer and Comfort Seeker, which apparently means I want world-class food, a packed itinerary, and neon lights at midnight. The description said Shanghai and I are both restless and impossible to box in, which felt uncomfortably accurate. Runners-up were Shenzhen (71%), Zhuhai (65%), Dalian (63%), and Hangzhou (61%). Not a bad China shortlist. Try it yourself — bestcityinchina.site
