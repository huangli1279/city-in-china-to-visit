    <h1>Beijing vs Shanghai: Which City Is Better for Your First China Trip?</h1>
    <p class="article-intro">Beijing and Shanghai are the two most common first stops in China. Each offers a very different first-trip experience.</p>
    <ul class="list-cards">
      <li>Pick Beijing for history depth, landmarks, and culture-heavy itineraries.</li>
<li>Pick Shanghai for city energy, modern convenience, and nightlife.</li>
<li>If undecided, use a travel-style matcher to validate which city aligns with your pace.</li>
    </ul>
    <section class="article-block">
  <h2>1. Attraction type: imperial history vs modern city life</h2>
  <p>Beijing is built around heritage experiences: the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, and nearby sections of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>Shanghai is stronger for contemporary neighborhoods, skyline viewpoints, food variety, and urban exploration.</p>
</section>
<section class="article-block">
  <h2>2. Planning complexity and travel pace</h2>
  <p>Beijing works best with a planned route and early starts because major landmarks are spread out.</p>
<p>Shanghai is often easier for flexible travelers who prefer shorter planning cycles and spontaneous activities.</p>
</section>
    <section class="article-block faq-item">
      <h2>Is Beijing or Shanghai better for tourists?</h2>
      <p>Beijing is better for history-first travel. Shanghai is better for modern city experiences and convenience. The best choice depends on your trip goals.</p>
