    <h1>Best China Cities by Travel Style</h1>
    <p class="article-intro">The fastest way to choose where to go in China is to match city type with your travel style instead of searching city-by-city.</p>
    <ul class="list-cards">
      <li>History-first travelers often match with Beijing and Xi an.</li>
<li>Nature and slow-travel travelers often match with Guilin, Dali, and Sanya.</li>
<li>Food and social-energy travelers frequently match with Chengdu, Chongqing, and Guangzhou.</li>
    </ul>
    <section class="article-block">
  <h2>1. History and heritage style</h2>
  <p>If old architecture, museums, and dynastic history are your top interests, prioritize Beijing and Xi an.</p>
<p>These cities reward travelers who are happy to spend more time at major sites.</p>
</section>
<section class="article-block">
  <h2>2. City energy and social nightlife style</h2>
  <p>If you want a dense urban trip with social scenes and late-night activity, Shanghai and Chongqing are strong candidates.</p>
<p>Both cities are also good for travelers who prefer high activity and flexible plans.</p>
</section>
<section class="article-block">
  <h2>3. Landscape and calm pace style</h2>
  <p>If scenic views and low-pressure itineraries matter most, look at Guilin, Dali, and Sanya.</p>
<p>These cities are typically better fits for slower pacing and restorative travel.</p>
</section>
    <section class="article-block faq-item">
      <h2>How do I choose the best city in China for my travel style?</h2>
      <p>Start by ranking your priorities: history, city life, nature, comfort, pace, and social vibe. Then map your top priorities to city profiles and compare the top three matches.</p>
