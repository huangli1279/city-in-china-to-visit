    <h1>Best City to Visit in China for First-Time Travelers</h1>
    <p class="article-intro">There is no single best city to visit in China for everyone. For first-time travelers, the best first stop depends on what you want your trip to feel like.</p>
    <ul class="list-cards">
      <li>Choose Shanghai if you want modern convenience and easy transport.</li>
<li>Choose Beijing if imperial history and landmarks are your top priority.</li>
<li>Choose Xi&#39;an, Chengdu, or Guilin when you want culture, food, or nature over big-city speed.</li>
    </ul>
    <section class="article-block">
  <h2>1. Define your first-trip priority before picking a city</h2>
  <p>Most decision mistakes happen when travelers compare cities without a clear priority. Start with one primary goal: history, food, nightlife, nature, or comfort.</p>
<p>If your priority is unclear, city choice becomes random. A structured quiz-based approach narrows options much faster than generic ranking lists.</p>
</section>
<section class="article-block">
  <h2>2. Use language comfort to reduce planning risk</h2>
  <p>If you prefer high convenience and easier navigation, Shanghai and Shenzhen are usually lower friction.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with local immersion, cities like Xi an, Chongqing, and Dunhuang can deliver richer local experiences.</p>
</section>
    <section class="article-block faq-item">
      <h2>What is the best city to visit in China for first-time tourists?</h2>
      <p>For many first-time tourists, Shanghai and Beijing are common starting points. The better answer depends on your travel style, which is why personalized matching often performs better than one-size-fits-all lists.</p>
