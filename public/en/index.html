    <h2>How to choose the best city to visit in China</h2>
    <p>There is no single best city for everyone. The right first stop depends on your travel style, language comfort, and pace. This quiz narrows that decision with structured matching instead of generic rankings.</p>
    <ul class="list-cards">
      <li>If you want big-city energy, nightlife, and modern convenience, start with Shanghai or Shenzhen.</li>
<li>If history and culture are your priority, Beijing and Xi&#39;an usually match better.</li>
<li>If landscapes and slower travel matter more, Guilin, Dali, and Sanya are often better first choices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use your quiz result as a starting point, then plan flights, season, and budget around your top 5 city matches.</p>
